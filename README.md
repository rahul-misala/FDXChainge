# FDXChainge
Transform traditional Fixed Deposits (FDs) into liquid, tradable tokens with FDXChainge â€“ a decentralized platform bridging traditional finance and DeFi. Tokenize FDs, unlock instant liquidity, and earn higher yields through a peer-to-peer marketplace, all powered by trustless smart contracts.

This project was built as part of the BVRIT Hackfiniti Hackathon, a national-level competition, where we emerged as finalists and secured a spot in the top 10.
